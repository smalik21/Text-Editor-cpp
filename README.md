# Text Editor cpp
This repository contains a program that implements a text editor using Linked List and Stack data structures. 

Each line of text is stored in a linked list node, which consists of a data portion holding the text and a pointer to the next node of the linked list, which is the next line of the text. 

The program offers the following functionalities: 

parsing each line into a linked list, 

inserting text into a specified line number, 

deleting a specified line, 

interchanging two specified lines, 

replacing text in a specified line, 

and undoing an action (implemented using a Stack).
