# Text Editor cpp
This repository contains a program that implements a text editor using Linked List and Stack data structures. 

Each line of text is stored in a node of the linked list, which consists of the text and a pointer to the next line of text. This program has many useful features to help users in various ways. The parsing of each line into a linked list allows users to easily process their text. 

Insertion, deletion, and replacement of text can be done based on a specified line number to make modifications effortless. Additionally, interchanging two specified lines of text is a feature that can be used for more complex editing tasks. 
For convenience, the program also offers an undo action that is implemented using a Stack data structure.
