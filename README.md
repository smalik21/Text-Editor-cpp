# Text Editor cpp
This program implements a text editor using Linked List and Stack data 
structures. 
Each line of text is saved into a linked list node, which consists of a data 
portion holding the text and a pointer to the next node of the linked list, 
which is the next line of the text. The program makes use of Stack data 
structure to implement the Undo function.
